              <h2>Data Analysis New York City Airbnb </h2>
              <p>
                Tableau is a powerful data visualization tool that can be used to analyze Airbnb data and identify which neighborhoods are more expensive.

                To start, you would need to gather data on Airbnb listings in the area of interest. This data could be obtained through the Airbnb API or by scraping the Airbnb website. The data should include information such as the listing price, location (e.g., neighborhood), and other relevant details such as the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.

                Once you have the data, you can use Tableau to create a visualization that shows the average listing price for each neighborhood. To do this, you would first connect to the data in Tableau and then create a new worksheet. On the worksheet, you would place the neighborhood dimension on the Columns shelf and the average listing price measure on the Rows shelf. You could also use filters to exclude outliers or particular types of properties.

                You can also use Tableau's built-in mapping capabilities to create a map that shows the average listing price for each neighborhood. To do this, you would place the neighborhood dimension on the Columns shelf and the average listing price measure on the Color shelf. Then, you would drag the neighborhood dimension to the Location shelf, which will create a map.

                You can use color, size or shapes to differentiate the neighborhoods by its average price. Additionally, you can use the tooltips feature to show more information when hovering over a neighborhood.

                In this way, you can quickly identify which neighborhoods have higher average listing prices and which have lower prices, as well as which neighborhoods are more popular.

                It's important to note that this analysis is based on the data you have scraped or obtained, so it's important to ensure the quality of the data and that the data is representative of the area of interest.
